Requested by **rzzirrah** this mod was orignially the [North American Street Signs](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/115319/Windows) mod that is outdated,
it got heavily modified to be similar like my Vanilla Overrider.

**Please use either this or one Vanilla Overrider at one time!**

## Functions
- Variable working Street Signs on Signposts, Traffic Lights and on Bus Station Shelter(NA Only)!

##  Requirements
- [Write Everywhere](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/92908/Windows) – required 100%
